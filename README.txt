As of 2024-08-17, this mod will probably not be updated by me as I lost interest
in Minetest a long time ago and probably will not be coming back.

If you do want to make any changes, here was my list of TODO items that I never got around to:
- Update meta stuff (readme, version, mod.conf, etc.)
- Change settings file to not use do_file and add options for custom messages (with placement of player name(s) anywhere in the message)
- Add some kind of translation support (may be covered by custom messages)
- Use the new API features to poperly detect types of death that weren't feasible before
- Make a small API for registering custom messages for other mods (see dying by corium in technic)
